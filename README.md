# Community-Detection-using-BigCLAM

In this project, we will explore network community detection using the BigCLAM algorithm. Specifically, 
we will develop an algorithm to find overlapping communities in the given network â€“ which means a node 
can present in multiple communities in the given network. We formulate the community detection as a non-negative matrix factorization with maximum log-likelihood estimation problem by parametrizing node 
strength in communities. 

This project is a simple version of experiments done in https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2433396.2433471
